    <h1> Hello</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Nigeria: To begin with, my name is chidi olekanma. I am born in a family of three children, precisely, drama, cultural movies, , in Imo state the southeast of Nigeria. Hobbies, I like traveling, cooking, shopping, I got my first associate degree 2006 in computer science in Nigeria and then I decided to travel to Western word in searching of education and betterment of life. The decision of this journey and its outcome help to drown my attention to one of father’s proverbs “the sound of bitter cola is difference from its teste. Life is full of stories, </p>
<p1>In addition, Belize is a first I landed. Belize is a small country found in Caribbean. It is a small island with the same Canada system of government. Where they have districts instead of states. Governor general is the head of state unlike united state like president as the head of state. Cultural is different. I have not really had any idea of the place, nor did I do proper research because I like travelling and it is an opportunity to experience a new world. I thought Belize is like united state, until I got there, the case is totally difference. I have no choice after a lot of money was spent. I experience a huge life in Belize because I lived six and half years before I to move to USA. Regarding the USA,</p1>
<p2>I movedto united state 2014. My first experience was cold and snow which I have not seen such weather whole of my life. I only read and watch it in books and on television, It was so amazing to see it live, but the biggest shock is the culture. Life in the USA is faster and you the documents to work with too many processes. compared to Belize and Nigeria. In contrast, Job opportunity, technology, education and infrastructure in united state of America are excellent. I called it “the melting point of the universe”. Secondly, VS code is a code editor that is used to developers write, build, and debug code. Git is a free open-source version control system which is used to track, change, and store code while GitHub is a web platform which uses developers to store, share, and collaborate on code, and it also serves as interface.  
    Web Design Tools Class. This can be described as a process of creating websites through building projects, design, and coding. This subject has been one of the classes I admire due to it design and creativity.  In this class “ITSE 1301, Web Design Tools” I am learning a lot, but I will mention few. It is not easy because it requires a lost of work, but very interesting and grater to achieve. Nowadays, Web Design is one of the fascinating job careers. With class, I am learning how the use of Virtual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub to build, design and publish it online.

<p3>In conclusion, my life is full of stories, working hard for the betterment of the future. </p3>
